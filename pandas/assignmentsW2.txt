Question 3
Which country has the biggest difference between their summer gold medal counts and winter gold medal counts relative to their total gold medal count?
Summer Gold-Winter GoldTotal Gold
Summer Gold-Winter GoldTotal Gold
 
Only include countries that have won at least 1 gold in both summer and winter.
This function should return a single string value.

import numpy as np

    only_gold = df[df['Gold'] > 0]
    return np.argmax((only_gold['Gold'] - only_gold['Gold.1'])/only_gold['Gold.2'] )
answer_three()

**********
Question 4
Write a function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value where each gold medal (Gold.2) counts for 3 points, silver medals (Silver.2) for 2 points, and bronze medals (Bronze.2) for 1 point. The function should return only the column (a Series object) which you created.
This function should return a Series named Points of length 146

    point=[]
    for index,row in df.iterrows():
        point.append(row['Gold.2']*3 + row ['Silver.2']*2 + row['Bronze.2']*1)
    pointsSeries=pd.Series(point,df.index)
    return pointsSeries
